/**
 * Main interface.
 * <p>
 * The {@code C} parameter defines the configuration interface being used. For example:
 * <pre>
 *     {@code
 *         interface MyConfig {
 *             default String helloWorld() { return "hi"; }
 *
 *             default boolean enabled() { return true; }
 *         }
 *
 *         Configuration<MyConfig> configuration;
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <b>Obtaining</b>
 * <p>
 * The factory methods {@code defaultBuilder} provide configuration builders. The builder lets the library user add
 * type liaisons, change the locale for error messages, add migrations, and change advanced settings. Use
 * {@link ConfigurationBuilder#build()} to get an instance of this interface.
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage</b>
 * <p>
 * The main point of usage is the {@link #configureWith(Backend)} method. This method performs many of the main features
 * of this library, and it will be suitable for many users. At the same time, this method is purely implemented using
 * library functions - meaning that any library user who wants to tweak its behavior can implement it themselves.
 * <p>
 * To add simple error handling to <code>configureWith</code>, see {@link #configureOrFallback(Backend, ErrorPrint)}.
 * <p>
 * <b>Preservation of order</b>
 * <p>
 * Throughout the library, order is preserved from start to finish. From the moment the data is loaded from
 * the backend, to the moment it is written back, order stays consistent.
 * <p>
 * That said, there are three reasons why the order of entries in a data tree would appear differently:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>1. The {@code Backend} implementation does not preserve order. If the backend does not preserve order, then
 *     order is undefined. Callers can inquire about this behavior using {@link Backend.Meta#preservesOrder(boolean)}.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>2. The {@code Instantiator} does not scan a configuration interface (i.e., its methods) in a consistent order.
 *     For example, the Java reflections API defines no order for {@link Class#getDeclaredMethods()}</li>
 *     <li>3. If the user deletes existing entries, the library may attempt to add them back. Adding back the missing
 *     entries will succeed if substitute values exist (see {@link DefaultValues#ifMissing()}), however, those missing
 *     entries will be added at the back of existing data trees.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <C> the configuration type
