/**
 * Adds comments to a configuration entry or type.
 * <p>
 * This annotation can be repeated multiple times to specify comments in different locations. Please note that
 * writing this annotation multiple times for the same location will simply result in that location being overidden.
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage on a method</b>
 * <p>
 * This annotation is frequently applied to configuration methods. If applied, the comments will be attached to that
 * method where it is declared (due to the nature of Java inheritance, comments may need to be re-specified if the
 * method is overidden).
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage on a class</b>
 * <p>
 * This annotation can also be applied to a class. If so, the comments will be associated with that class, and they
 * will be added wherever a configuration method declares that class as its return type. If both the method-level
 * annotation and class-level annotation exist, the method-level annotation will take precedence.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, if the annotated class is a configuration interface itself, the comments specified will become
 * top-level comments in the configuration definition. Such top-level comments are passed directly to the backend.
