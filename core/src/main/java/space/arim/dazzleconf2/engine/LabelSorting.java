/**
 * Controls how labels are sorted.
 * <p>
 * <b>Preservation of order</b>
 * <p>
 * Throughout the library, order is preserved from start to finish. From the moment the {@code DataTree} is loaded from
 * the backend, to the moment it is written back, order stays consistent. The only exception to the <i>preservation of
 * order</i> rule is that
 * <p>
 * <b>Sources of disorder</b>
 * <p>
 * That said, there are three reasons why the order of entries in a data tree would appear differently:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>1. The {@code Backend} implementation does not preserve order. If the backend does not preserve order, then
 *     order is undefined. Callers can inquire about this behavior using {@link Backend.Meta#preservesOrder(boolean)}.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>2. The {@code Instantiator} does not scan a configuration interface (i.e., its methods) in a consistent order.
 *     For example, the Java reflections API defines no order for {@link Class#getDeclaredMethods()}</li>
 *     <li>3. When loading a configuration, if missing entries are present (and substitute values exist, see
 *     {@link DefaultValues#ifMissing()}), then those missing entries will be added at the back.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>This Interface's Role</b>
 * <p>
 * This interface allows library callers to override the output order when writing to a data tree. By default, it is
 * implemented by {@code Configuration#configureWith} if the backend can write (but not read) order; this removes
 * the first source (listed above) of undefined order.
