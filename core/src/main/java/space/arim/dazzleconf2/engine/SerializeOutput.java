 * The output for serialization, which is handed to {@link SerializeDeserialize#serialize}.
 * <p>
 * Serializers <b>MUST</b> call one of the output methods in this class. The output methods start with "out" and are
 * distinguished by the argument type, which helps callers ensure that they are passing a valid output type.
 * If no object is output when {@code serialize} returns, that is considered a library usage error, and an exception
 * may be thrown at a later time.
 * <p>
 * <b>Advanced usage</b>
 * <p>
 * This {@code SerializeOutput} stores the last object output to it. Calling more than one "out" method will overwrite
 * the value stored in this instance, which will in turn change the return value of this method. This output can be
 * extracted (and simultaneously cleared) by calling {@link #getAndClearLastOutput()}.
