/**
 * Version 2 of the library, provided as a separate package.
 * <p>
 * This package bundles all the libraries from version 2, along with sub-packages. Thus, it allows you to depend on
 * version 1 and version 2 side-by-side, which can be helpful for migration purposes.
 * <p>
 * However, note that version 2 itself (the version 2 artifact) will <b>NOT</b> use this package prefix. Instead,
 * the version 2 artifact uses the regular namespace (<code>space.arim.dazzleconf2</code>) and you'll need to perform
 * a refactor at a later time. Uusing an IDE, it's possible to change all usages of {@code space.arim.dazzleconf2}
 * to {@code space.arim.dazzleconf}.
