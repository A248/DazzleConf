/**
 * A key path consists of an ordered sequence of strings.
 * <p>
 * Example: "my.brave.world" is a key path consisting of three strings. The front of the key path would be "my" and the
 * back would be "enabled". A {@code KeyPath} stores the ordered sequence and can be expanded at the front or the
 * back, but it cannot be shrunk (this class does not support shrinking).
 * <p>
 * <b>Printing and display</b>
 * <p>
 * This class implements {@link Printable} for display purposes. The dot-separated form will be the displayed product:
 * <pre>
 *     {@code
 *     KeyPath myBraveWorld = new KeyPath("my", "brave", "world"); // var-args constructor
 *     assert "my.brave.world".equals(myBraveWorld.printString());
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <b>Mutability and locking changes</b>
 * <p>
 * {@code KeyPath} is mutable by default. However, an instance can be immutably locked it with
 * {@link #lockChanges()}, and a locked instance can be relied upon to never change (unlocking is not possible).
 * As a consequence, {@code KeyPath} is only thread safe if changes are locked.
 * <p>
 * <b>Key mapping</b>
 * A {@code KeyPath} stores strings without distinction. However, users can add key mapping with
 * {@link #applyKeyMapper(KeyMapper)}. If a key mapper is applied, it will map all existing key parts in this
 * {@code KeyPath}, as well as automatically map new key parts added (whether to the front or part). When those
 * same key parts are output at a later time (e.g. through <code>printString</code> or <code>intoParts</code>),
 * they are guaranteed to have been run through the mapper.
 * <p>
 * A key mapper, if attached to an instance of this class, is treated as "invisible" to other {@code KeyPath}
 * instances. The key mapper itself will never be copied to another instance, even if its (mapped) key parts are.
 *
