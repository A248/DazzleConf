/**
 * Configuration backend for reading and writing data trees.
 * <p>
 * <b>Configuration formats and options</b>
 * <p>
 * A backend typically represents a configuration format, such as YAML or Json, using another library to handle parsing
 * syntax. Some formats will expose the capability to behave differently - whether to change printing style, support
 * commenting workarounds, or accept escape sequences. Backends can provide such options through constructor
 * parameters.
 * <p>
 * Some configuration formats define null values. If a backend discovers a null value, it should treat the key/value
 * pair as non-existent.
 * <p>
 * Backends are not required to support comments, but it is strongly preferred if they do. If comments <i>are</i>
 * supported, the backend <b>must</b> round-trip those comments between successive calls to <code>read</code> and
 * <code>write</code>.
 * <p>
 * <b>Data roots</b>
 * <p>
 * A backend will typically require some {@link DataRoot} (or subclass thereof) as the raw source. This requirement is
 * often expressed by a constructor parameter.
 *

    /**
     * Reads data. Upon full success, the backend returns a nonnull document.
     * <p>
     * <b>Emptiness</b>
     * <p>
     * If no data exists at the source, a {@code null} value should be returned. An example of this would be if the
     * backend were using a {@link PathRoot} and the file in question did not exist: the implementor of this method
     * would check {@link DataRoot#dataExists()} in this case.
     * <p>
     * In other cases, data might exist but be blank. Here, {@code Backend}s should behave in a manner appropriate
     * to the validity of blank data in their schema. Either {@code null} or an error should be returned depending on
     * whether blank data is a syntax exception. For example, a blank file is a valid document in YAML, and the
     * implementor of this method would return a null document. A blank file is not valid in JSON, so a parse error
     * might be triggered instead.
     * <p>
     * <b>Syntax errors</b>
     * <p>
     * If the loading failed because the data is malformatted, an error result should be returned. The error message
     * can be given as {@link ErrorContext#BACKEND_MESSAGE}. Additionally, backends can recommend a syntax linter by
     * using {@link ErrorContext#SYNTAX_LINTER}.
     * <p>
     * <b>IO errors</b>
     * <p>
     * A backend is permitted to throw {@code UncheckedIOException} to handle I/O errors coming from the data root.

     * @param errorSource a factory for the backend to produce errors

     * <p>
     * If the comment header is non-empty, some of it may need to be written before the rest of the data, and some of it
     * may need to be written after the data. If not supported by this backend, this comment header may be ignored.
     * <p>
     * <b>Unsupported Data</b>
     * <p>
     * Not all configuration formats follow a data structure that aligns with {@link DataTree}'s key/value model with
     * nestable trees. For example, <code>.properties</code> files don't provide nested sections, and HOCON supports
     * only string-valued keys (integer keys are impossible).
     * <p>
     * When unsupported data structure is encountered, the implementor should throw {@link DeveloperMistakeException}.
     * Throwing an exception is the appropriate way to signal an incompatible configuration structure. While this makes
     * some configuration definitions constricted to compatible formats, such fail-fast behavior follows this library's
     * culture. If need be, library users can always write migrations to change their configuration definition.
