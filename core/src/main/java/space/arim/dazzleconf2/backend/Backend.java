/**
 * Configuration backend for reading and writing data trees.
 * <p>
 * <b>Configuration formats and options</b>
 * <p>
 * A backend typically represents a configuration format, such as YAML or Json, using another library to handle parsing
 * syntax. Some formats will expose the capability to behave differently - whether to change printing style, support
 * commenting workarounds, or accept escape sequences. Backends can provide such options through constructor
 * parameters.
 * <p>
 * Backends are not required to support comments, but it is strongly preferred if they do. If comments <i>are</i>
 * supported, the backend <b>must</b> round-trip those comments between successive calls to <code>read</code> and
 * <code>write</code>.
 * <p>
 * <b>Data roots</b>
 * <p>
 * A backend will typically require some {@link DataRoot} (or subclass thereof) as the raw source. This requirement is
 * often expressed by a constructor parameter.
 *

    /**
     * Reads data.
     * <p>
     * <b>Success values and streaming</b>
     * <p>
     * Upon success, the backend returns streamable data. It is recommended for the backend to implement
     * {@link DataStreamable#getAsStream()} in an efficient manner.
     * <p>
     * Streams cannot communicate errors, however, meaning that any errors need to be returned from this method itself.
     * Thus, this method cannot provide "pure" streaming, and some kind of intermediate buffer (like format-specific
     * data) will need to be loaded into memory before this method can return.
     * <p>
     * However, there is still value in the backend implementing a stream-efficient return value. Some callers might
     * want to filter keys and values before adding them to a data tree, and other callers may not want a tree at all.
     * <p>
     * <b>Emptiness</b>
     * <p>
     * If no data exists at the source, a {@code null} value should be returned. An example of this would be if the
     * backend were using a {@link PathRoot} and the file in question did not exist: the implementor of this method
     * would check {@link DataRoot#dataExists()} in this case.
     * <p>
     * In other cases, data might exist, but it will be blank. For example, a blank file is a valid document in YAML,
     * and the implementor of this method would thus return a non-null {@code DataTree} with no content in it.
     * <p>
     * <b>Syntax errors</b>
     * <p>
     * If the loading failed because the data exists but was malformatted, an error result should be returned. The
     * error message can be given as {@link ErrorContext#BACKEND_MESSAGE}.
     * <p>
     * <b>IO errors</b>
     * <p>
     * A backend is permitted to throw {@code UncheckedIOException} in two places: either this method itself, or in
     * usage of the {@code Stream} returned by the streamable instance. The latter case is rare but theoretically
     * possible.
     *
     * @return a load result of the data
     * @throws UncheckedIOException upon I/O failure
