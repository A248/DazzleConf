 * Implementing this interface correctly requires a number of considerations. It is recommended to check the library
 * source code as a reference implementation.
 * <p>
 * An {@code Instantiator} is supposed to implement equality among instances produced by it. Instances produced by
 * other {@code Instantiator} implementations should never be equal to instances produced by this one.

     * simple as implementing a local interface as a marker.

    /**
     * Generates the target class.
     * <p>
     * Speaking logically, this function takes a map of methods to return values, and generates an implementation of
     * the requested interface(s) which, when its methods are called, yields the preconfigured values. This function
     * is therefore an important backbone of the whole library, and the generated instance should operate as
     * performantly as feasible.
     * <p>
     * The values to be returned from each method are defined by the {@code MethodYield}. The method yield can be
     * queried for each interface to be implemented, and a map of methods to values will be given. Note that
     * {@link InvokeDefaultFunction} is a dummy object which should instruct the implementor to call the default
     * function instead of returning that dummy object.
     * <p>
     * <b>Implementation Targets</b>
     * <p>
     * The {@code targets} argument defines the interfaces implemented by the generated object. For every target class
     * provided, the {@code MethodYield} will fully specify the return values of each function from the interface. That
     * is to say, using {@link MethodYield#valuesFor(Class)} with the interface will provide a complete map of method
     * IDs to return value instructions.
     * <p>
     * Additionally, the targets will cover the complete type hierarchy for sub-interfaces. If one of the targets
     * extends another interface, the parent interface will also be in the array.
     * <p>
     * The {@code targets} array will always be delivered in a stable (deterministic) order, meaning the
     * {@code Instantiator} implementation can rely on that order to define equality across multiple instances produced
     * by this function.
     * <p>
     * Also, both the caller <b>AND</b> the implementor agree not to modify the {@code targets} array upon the call
     * of this method.
     * <p>
     * <b>Equality</b>
     * <p>
     * Calling this function with equal {@code targets} and {@code methodYield} parameters should yield equal instances.
     * That is to say, an instance is equal to another if it has the same behavior (yields the same values, and calls
     * the same default methods).
     *
     * @param classLoader where to generate the class file if necessary
     * @param targets the target interfaces to implement
     * @param methodYield a map of methods to the values they are to yield
     * @return the generated implementation
