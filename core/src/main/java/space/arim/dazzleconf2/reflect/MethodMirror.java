/**
 * Service for traversing a type hierarchy and getting and invoking methods on types in that hierarchy.
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage</b>
 * <p>
 * Usage is only valid with interface types. A {@code MethodMirror} can traverse the declared methods of an interface
 * yielding {@code MethodId} for each of them, and it can call those methods in a possibly-efficient manner. It should
 * never return bridge or synthetic methods.
 * <p>
 * <b>Implementing</b>
 * <p>
 * Implementing this interface correctly requires a number of considerations. It is recommended to check the library
 * source code as a reference implementation.
