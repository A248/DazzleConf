Prepare to be dazzled

## Introduction

It's here. The moment you've been waiting for.

A type-safe, thread-safe, fail-fast, user-oriented, easy to setup, extensible and flexible configuration library.

### Objectives

* *Eliminate* stringly-typed spaghetti such as `getString("key")` or `getAsInt("section.subsection")`. Use your configuration just as you would any other immutable bean.

* *Write defaults once* and never bother with them again.

* *Validate configuration* in all manners, and fail-fast with informative messages.

* *Easily update* old configurations with the latest keys. No need to version config files.

* *Pave the way* for users with incredibly flexible type conversion.

* *Take advantage of* enums, collections, and nested configuration sections.

### Features

* Lightweight, simple, well-tested library.
* Immutable and thread safe by design. Values loaded once and never modified thereafter.
* Readable for programmers and users. Annotation-driven and supports comments.
* Configuration objects are format-independent.
* Support for writing configs as YAML and JSON out of the box, but allows easy extension with more formats.
* Identify the precise cause of user errors.
* Use a decoupled and testable config interface.

## Usage

### Example

```java
public interface MyConfig {

  @DefaultInteger(3)
  int someInteger();
  
  @ConfKey("display.user-message")
  @ConfComments("The message shown when a certain thing happens")
  @DefaultString("Hello user")
  String userMessage();
  
  @ConfKey("display.enable-user-message")
  @DefaultBoolean(true)
  boolean enableUserMessage();
  
  @IntegerRange(min = 1, max = Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1)
  @DefaultLong(10)
  long boundedNumeric();
  
  @DefaultString("ONE")
  MyEnum enumValue();
  
  @SubSection
  NestedSection nestedConfigSection();
  
  @ConfSerialiser(URLSerialiser.class)
  @DefaultString("https://github.com")
  URL validUrl();

}

public enum MyEnum {
  ONE,
  TWO
}


public interface NestedSection {

  @ConfComments("Every annotation shown above works here too")
  @DefaultString("Also, methods are inherited if this interface extends another, enabling inheritable config interfaces")
  String flexibility();

}
```

When using the YAML configuration format, the following result can be generated by writing the default configuration:

```yaml
someInteger: 3
display:
  # The message shown when a certain thing happens
  user-message: 'Hello user'
  enable-user-message: true
boundedNumeric: 10
enumValue: 'ONE'
nestedConfigSection:
  # Every annotation shown above works here too
  flexibility: 'Also, methods are inherited if this interface extends another, enabling inheritable config interfaces'
validUrl: 'https://github.com'
```

The same document can be reparsed to an instance of the configuration interface. Type and constraint validation is performed when config values are parsed and loaded, not when they are retrieved - having an instance of the config interface is enough to ensure the configuration is valid.

### Requirements

* Java 8

Java 11 is recommended, but not required.

`module-info` files are also included, and these are backwards compatible with Java 8.

### Getting Started

This page will help you out: https://github.com/A248/DazzleConf/wiki/Getting-Started

The wiki also has extra examples such as with setting up a reloadable configuration, automatically updating the configuration with the latest keys, and more.

### Documentation

See [the docs folder](https://github.com/A248/DazzleConf/tree/master/docs) of this repository for a detailed overview.

Additionally, the javadocs are published with the artifact. They can also be browsed [here](https://javadoc.io/doc/space.arim.dazzleconf/dazzleconf-core).
