When I first wrote DazzleConf, I was amazed at the way it came to life. I'd rounded off a few hard edges, covered up the gross internals, and wrote a fun, usable API. The result is what you see: DazzleConf 1.0, a cute little library that did its job. However, the API was mainly designed around simple loading, with primitives and strings in mind. Custom types were additional but not central, and the library had a couple quirks like over-using annotations.

Rewriting DazzleConf 2.0 allowed me to re-organize its parts and build an API-driven model. The outcome is far more powerful, beautiful, and expansive. It is, I hope, both conceptually simpler and ergonomically superior.

Returning users will therefore either love it or hate it. This guide is your one-stop shop for all matters related to version 2.0.
